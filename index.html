            Group. He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in
            architecture. He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded

            Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric
            group into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in the world, having donated
            around 60–65% of his income to charity.
